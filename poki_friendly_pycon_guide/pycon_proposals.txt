Info: PyCon India 2024 proposals Toggle navigation PyCon India 2024 Login / Register PyCon India 2024 Proposals 10 Mar - 09 Jun, 2024 Proposal submission closed Welcome to PyCon India 2024 Join us for the 15th edition of PyCon India, the premier Python conference in India, happening in the bustling tech hub of Bengaluru, famously dubbed as the "Silicon Valley of India." From September 20 to 23, 2024, the Python community will come alive in a celebration of innovation, learning, and collaboration. This annual gathering brings together Python enthusiasts, developers, and industry professionals for four days of inspiring Talks, hands-on Workshops, and networking opportunities. Visit the official website for more information: https://in.pycon.org/2024/ Call For Proposals   Proposals for Talks and Workshops are invited from Python enthusiasts. Submissions open on 10th March 2024 and end on 9th June 2024. Talks Technical talks are the most important event at PyCon India, the core of the conference. Two of the four days are dedicated to talks. Talks are short lectures that are 30 minutes long   and can be on any topic related to Python. Speakers come from the Python community. Talks are selected through a CFP   process. Interested members of the community may propose their talks through an application. An editorial panel designated by the organizers has been entrusted with a procedural methodology for selecting the talk. In the 2023 edition, the conference received an impressive 228 proposals, out of which 39 were selected. For more details and insights, read the CFP announcement blog post. CFP applications from the previous year can be seen here. Important Points Talk duration is 30 minutes   CFP closes on 9th June 2024 Schedule shall be released on 1st September 2024 Talks will be presented on 21st and 22nd September 2024 We may have up to 3 parallel tracks of talks in each session. The morning session will run from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The evening session will run from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Format The format of each talk will be up to the speaker but should include a mix of lectures, demos, and Q&A. Workshops These are 3-hour-long interactive sessions where attendees can learn by doing. Hands-on learning is as important as talks for a fulfilling conference experience. Like talks, workshops are also conducted by the members of the Python community. Anyone can propose conducting a workshop. Any topic of interest to the Python community is okay - the workshop should help attendees learn a new skill, technology, or library. To get a sense of the topics from last year, take a look here. In the CFP proposal, please mention an outline of the workshop and the prerequisites and the slides if possible. Also, mention if you have conducted the same workshop before. The workshop should be interspersed with proper hands-on exercises. After the workshop people should be ramped up on the workshop topic and should be able to take it forward themselves. To know about Best practices please check the Workshop Proposal Announcement blog post. Important Points Workshop duration is 3 hours   CFP closes on 9th June 2024 Schedule shall be released on 1st September 2024 Workshops will be conducted on 20th September 2024 We may have up to 3 parallel tracks of workshops in each session. The morning session will run from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The evening session will run from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Format Workshops are aimed at beginner, intermediate, and advanced experience-level participants. Workshop proposals must include a detailed outline of the covered topics and allocated time. Important Dates CFP for Talks and Workshop Open on 10th March 2024 and closes on 9th June 2024. What to Propose Anything of interest to Python programmers is welcome. However, there are a few topics that we feel might be great - Lessons from using Python in your project. Did you find something against conventional wisdom? Something confirming conventional wisdom? Do you have advice for people solving similar problems? Example - I tried Python for video processing, or in my medical imaging project, and here are the lessons. Something you're doing to make the language/ecosystem better. Writing a library to solve an interesting problem? Or have some new ideas on optimization. Something you learned from a different language that may be useful to the Python community. How about a type system? Or patterns from functional programming. Or logic programming maybe? Thoughts on tech culture and living. Ideas on improving diversity and inclusiveness. On programmers’ physical and mental health. On getting better at productivity. On workplace issues. Anything that can make an impact, especially if you have used Python for any of the above or have seen someone using Python. And if you don't get any ideas along these lines, try plain and simple teaching. Pick up a niche topic  , and help us learn. A well-delivered lecture even at a beginner level is often well-received. The Review Process Authors should propose their talks using the CFP application CFP volunteers review the proposals for completeness Once the proposals are ready, they are reviewed by a panel of experts If the proposal does not look complete, or the reviewers need clarifications, the author is notified via comments The panel of experts finally vote on the proposals A pre-final shortlist is eventually prepared based on the votes The shortlisted proposals go through a round of rehearsals   A final list is created and published. Rehearsals Shortlisted speakers will be expected to participate in rehearsal sessions. Rehearsals will be done via teleconferencing, where the speaker shall give a mock run of their talks in a time-bound manner. The audience will consist of volunteers, reviewers, and possibly other speakers. The speakers will be given feedback if necessary. The point of this exercise is to make sure speakers are ready with their talks ahead of time. And also, to make sure they can finish the talk in the stipulated time. It is useful for the speakers too as they'd get feedback on the content delivery and presentation. Participation in the rehearsal sessions is likely to be a required step - chances of an unrehearsed talk making it to the final stage are substantially lower. Diversity We in the Python community believe in making our community more diverse. This means we are encouraging content from diverse walks of life. This also means we want to improve participation from under-represented groups. Our goal is to maximize content from under-represented groups. You can help us by encouraging your friends, family, and colleagues to submit talks. You can also help by mentoring. Also note that we have a strict code-of-conduct. This is to make it clear, in intent and practice, that we are committed to making the conference a pleasant, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone, especially for under-represented groups. Best Practices for Speakers 1. Apply Even if you have a vague idea, submit a proposal. We're available for help with ideas and feedback  . Don't worry about communication skills or English - we are there to help with that too. And our focus is more on the content. 2. Make it detailed Add as much detail as possible to the proposal. Add the presentation slides if you already have one. Add a short minute video giving a summary of the proposal. More detail helps reviewers make better judgments. 3. Propose early We will start the review process as the proposals come in, and not at the end. Proposals submitted early will get more attention and feedback 4. The code of conduct Take a look at the code of conduct, and be mindful of it. The gist is, to be nice and avoid using sexist language. 5. Add a preview video Add a small intro video about what your talk is about to provide a preview to what's to be expected. We've put together a set of detailed best practices - take a look. It also contains links to some well-written proposals from previous years.

The world is still under the grasp on the COVID-19 pandemic, and from the lessons from the past conference around the globe, we know that conferences are a place where there is a high-change of communicating the disease. We love that people bring their unique perspectives -- but they also bring their local germs and Covid strains. We want PyCon India to be an event that everyone feels safe attending - therefore we are putting out this document for the attendees to follow during their time at PyCon India. Vaccination ¶ We strongly recommend to take the latest vacinnation boosters, and all attendees should be vaccinated. Please keep the your vaccine certificate handy incase asked for during the conference by the organizers. We also suggest you to monitor WHO travel advice or the local COVID-19 travel advisory.

It doesn't have to be something you've created, feel free to share something you've learned or a technique you think others will find useful. Is there something at work that everyone asks for your help with? Talk about that! Did you recently learn something that made a difference for you? Talk about that! Is there a topic you've always wanted to understand better? Talk about that! Slides are optional but encouraged! Things people say when they think they can't do a lightning talk ¶ "Everyone already knows THING_X" No, they don't. They believe they are knowledgeable, but you possess a deeper comprehension of the subject matter. They will gain valuable insights through this interaction. Even if they do, it's interesting to hear someone else's take on it. "I’m not an expert at anything" You know more than you think you do. You don't have to be an expert, you just have to be interested enough to talk for 5 minutes. You can do a 1-minute lightning talk if you want. "It's scary talking in front of people" Yes, but you will feel really accomplished when you've done it. Folks at PyCon are super-friendly and are always welcoming of new speakers. It is understandable that public speaking can induce nervousness in individuals, including those who may appear confident. You can give a lightning talk without talking! "I have an idea but it's no good" It's a better idea than you think. Are there really any bad ideas for lightning talks? :) Lightning Talks at PyCon India 2024 ¶ Please refer to the schedule for Lightning Talk slots. Registration will open on the day of the conference, and we will share a Google Form for submitting Lightning Talk proposals. Slots will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis due to limited availability. You will be notified if your talk is selected.

While most of the conference is planned well in advance, Open Spaces are created "just in time" by PyCon attendees during the conference. They provide a way for you to self-gather, self-define, and self-organize any way you like. How do I participate in an Open Space? ¶ It's pretty easy: Just show up :) During PyCon, there will be an Open Spaces board in dedicated rooms on Level 1 of the venue, maintained by a facilitator from the organizing committee. The board act as a time table for all the Open Spaces, so you know where and when to go for the Open Spaces you're interested in. If a topic is not listed yet, find an open time slot and describe it to the facilitator!! The speaker/host can decide the way he/she uses that space and time. Furthermore, the activities/talks at Open Spaces are not officially recorded in any ways, thus any topics that are more critical compared to the regular conference talks are welcomed. Ideas for Open Spaces ¶ Since the PyCon attendees are a diverse bunch, the Open Spaces are too. They can be some discussions about plenty of the usual suspects of technical subjects, from computer security to your favorite Python project to professional occupations like DevOps. Here are a few ideas for potential Open Space topics and activities: Hacking/networking/devops How to contribute to open source - a help / mentoring group for beginners Framework specific Open Spaces, for example, Django or Flask Data visualization/science Natural language processing and generation   Quantified Self Hacker space   that use Python A space for organizers - of conferences, workshops, diversity initiatives   Support - how to avoid burnout Recruitment workshops If there's a certain Open Space you'd love to see at PyCon but you don't want to host it yourself, please suggest it on our list and maybe someone else will take up the topic and host an Open Space about it. Role of the Facilitator ¶ A facilitator would be available to make sure PyCon attendees have everything they need to do self organize and also ensure the open spaces happen in an orderly fashion. When there is more than one idea, competing for the same time slot, facilitator will resolve the same via voting/or any other means he deems fit. The facilitator is responsible for maintaining the schedule for Open Spaces and also updating the rest of the attendees on twitter with hashtag - #OpenSpaces #PyConIndia2024 and also on google docs at Openspaces Schedule Planned Open Spaces ¶ If you have an idea for an Open Space, and a day and time when you want to meet/host, please email us at contact@in.pycon.org and we will try to accommodate by including them on schedule.

Info: BoFs and Posters 2024 proposals Toggle navigation BoFs and Posters 2024 Login / Register BoFs and Posters 2024 Proposals 10 Jun - 31 Jul, 2024 Proposal submission closed BoFs and Posters for PyCon India 2024 PyCon India provides numerous opportunities to gather, interact, and discuss with fellow Pythonistas. To foster community building, we emphasize interactive and engaging sessions, such as Birds of a Feather   and Poster sessions. Submit your proposal through BoF and Poster Submission Page. You can choose the category from the 'Proposal Type' dropdown. Here is a brief overview of both Categories. BoF Sessions Birds of a Feather sessions   are informal gatherings of like-minded individuals who wish to discuss a particular topic without a pre-planned agenda. BoFs provide an inclusive and informal environment where participants can freely share ideas. BoFs can be serious and serve as a great way to bring people from the community together to delve deep into a topic. However, they also offer opportunities to learn while having fun! Guidelines Duration: Each BoF Session will last for 30 mins. Selection: The CFP team will select the BoF sessions. Moderation The proposer of the session will serve as the moderator and initiate the session. The moderator's role is to ensure that the discussion is both guided and cohesive while encouraging audience participation. We invite the community to suggest ideas for BoF topics and volunteer as moderators. Please include a brief description of the BoF and potential panelists in your proposal. Proposal examples Discussing the book "Learn Python 3, the Hard Way" Application security in the world of LLMs PyScript adoption Python in Education LLMs in Production Poster Presentation Sessions Posters are graphical summaries of projects or ideas. They are usually presented with an A0-size poster, but any creative ways are always welcome. The poster session provides an opportunity to network with the conference attendees and acts as a starting point for further discussions. While talks generally need to appeal to a wide section of the community, posters can cover niche topics. PyCon India 2024 will be having a Poster Presentation Session on conference days. During the poster presentation session, you will be provided with a poster board that can hold an A0 size poster, and a table to place your laptop, for demos. Conference attendees interested in your topic will stop by, during which you can give them a brief presentation/demo. Poster Presentation Duration Conference Day 1, 21st September - Second Half Conference Day 2, 22nd September - Second Half FAQ What is the difference between a talk and a poster? Talks and posters are different ways of interacting with the conference audience. A topic can be presented as talk if the intention is to explain the topic in detail. A poster, on the other hand, is similar to a lightning talk, in that it quickly introduces the audience to a topic, and acts as a trigger point for further discussion. There are some specific cases where posters are better suited than talks: Due to the nature of the poster presentation format, it is better suited for demos, the attendees can interact with the project. This is especially useful for hardware projects. Visual presentations always attract the attendees to grasp the core concept of the topic If you are a first-time conference attendee or a first-time speaker at a conference, posters let you engage with the audience without getting intimidated by the large crowd. Niche topics that are domain-heavy, are better suited as posters. Examples: Python in local language computing, Python in embedded Linux build automation, Python used in the scientific study of ailments, etc. Can I submit both a talk and a poster proposal? You can submit a talk and poster proposal for the same topic. If your talk does not get selected, you can use the poster session, to introduce your topic, and engage with the audience. Given the limited space and time at the conference, only one of them will get selected though. What makes a good poster? First, ensure that you select a good title. Conference attendees will use it to determine which posters to attend. Make sure it brings in an audience who will be interested in your poster. Second, for the poster itself, here are a few tips for creating the poster: While textual representation is good, graphical representation will attract more eyes Make sure the contents are properly sized and spaced in the poster so that it is viewable from a decent distance Provoke the reader's curiosity which will open up space for further discussions Provide links for the attendees to know more about the topic and connect with you / the community Do you have sample poster proposals to get started? You can check the poster proposals from other conferences: PyCon India 2019 PyCon US 2019 Can I do a poster in a local language? Yes! Since attendees can choose which poster they want to attend, your poster can be in a local language. This makes sense only if there will be sufficient no. of participants who are familiar with the language. This can also be done, if the topic is itself about projects / libraries on regional language computing. Please be noted that the proposal itself needs to be in English, for the reviewers to be able to comprehend your proposal. Questions?

This annual gathering brings together Python enthusiasts, developers, and industry professionals for four days of inspiring Talks, hands-on Workshops, and networking opportunities. Visit the official website for more information: https://in.pycon.org/2023/ Talks Talks should be 30 minutes long   and can be on any topic related to Python. Schedule Talks will be there across the morning and evening sessions on September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2023,. We may have up to 3 parallel tracks of talks in each session. The morning session will run from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The evening session will run from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Format The format of each talk will be up to the speaker but should include a mix of lectures, demos, and Q&A. Workshops Workshops are 3 hrs long interactive sessions where attendees can learn by doing. Schedule Workshops will be held on September 29, 2023, across two morning and evening sessions. We may have up to 3 parallel tracks of workshops in each session. The morning session will run from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The evening session will run from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Format Workshops are aimed at beginner, intermediate, and advanced experience-level participants. Workshop proposals must include a detailed outline of the covered topics and allocated time. Important Dates CFP for Talks and Workshop closes on August 5. Selected Talks and Workshops will be announced on September 4. What to Propose Any topics of interest to Python programmers, with a focus on the following: Lessons learned from using Python in projects, including unconventional and conventional wisdom and advice for similar problem-solving. E.g., I tried Python for video processing or in my medical imaging project, and here are the lessons. Contributions to improving the Python language/ecosystem, such as creating libraries or proposing optimizations. Knowledge gained from other languages, like type systems, functional programming patterns, or logic programming. Thoughts on tech culture, diversity and inclusiveness, the physical and mental health of programmers, productivity improvement, workplace issues, and their impact when using Python. Alternatively, consider offering teaching sessions on niche topics, recent technologies, or scientific papers, even at a beginner level. Rehearsals Shortlisted speakers will be expected to participate in rehearsal sessions. We will conduct Rehearsals via teleconferencing, where the speaker shall give a mock run of their talks in a time-bound manner. The audience will include volunteers, reviewers, and possibly other speakers. We will give feedback to speakers if necessary. This exercise aims to ensure speakers are ready with their talks beforehand. And also to ensure they can finish the talk within the stipulated time. It is also helpful for the speakers to get feedback on the content delivery and presentation. Participation in the rehearsal sessions is likely to be required - chances of an unrehearsed talk making it to the final stage are substantially lower. Diversity We in the Python community believe in making our community more diverse. This suggests that we encourage content from diverse walks of life and also want to improve participation from under-represented groups. Our goal is to maximize content from under-represented groups. You can help us by encouraging your friends, family, and colleagues to submit talks. You can also help by mentoring. Also, note that we have a strict code of conduct. In intent and practice, we are committed to making the conference a pleasant, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone, especially for under-represented groups. Speaker Best Practices We've compiled a set of detailed best practices - take a look. Questions? Ping us on Zulip.

Info: BoFs and Posters 2021 proposals Toggle navigation BoFs and Posters 2021 Login / Register BoFs and Posters 2021 Proposals 17 - 20 Sep, 2021 Proposal submission closed PyCon India provides a lot of opportunities to get together, interact and have discussions with fellow pythonistas. In an effort to promote community growth we emphasize on interactive and engaging sessions like Birds of a Feather   and Poster Presentation. Submit your proposal through BoF and Poster Submission Page. You can choose the category from the 'Proposal Type' dropdown. Here is a brief overview of both Categories. BoF Sessions Birds of a Feather sessions   are informal gatherings of like-minded individuals who wish to discuss a certain topic without a pre-planned agenda. BoFs provide an inclusive and informal environment in which participants can share ideas freely. BoFs can be serious, and a great way to gather the people from the community in a common space to deep dive on a topic, but they can also bring opportunities to learn while having a lot of fun! PyCon India 2021 being an online event BoFs will be in the form of informal or relaxed panel discussions with active participation from the audience. The proposer of the session will act as moderator and start the session. The moderator will ensure that the discussion is both guided and cohesive and will encourage audience participation. We would like to invite the community for ideas and moderators for BoF topics. Please include a small description of the BoF and possible panelists in the proposal.

Info: PyCon India 2021 proposals Toggle navigation PyCon India 2021 Login / Register PyCon India 2021 Proposals 17 - 20 Sep, 2021 Schedule Published Welcome to PyCon India 2021 CFP The major change this year is the online format of the Conference. There are 2 categories of Proposals - Talks and Workshops. You can select the category from the 'Proposal Type' Dropdown in the Proposal Submission Page. Here is a brief overview of both Categories. Talks Technical talks are the most important event at PyCon India, the core of the conference essentially. Two of the four days are dedicated to talks. Talks are short lectures   supported by a presentation. Speakers come from the Python community. This year we have introduced a preview video section where you need to add a short preview video mentioning the overview of the Talk. To know read the CFP announcement blog post Talks are selected through a CFP   process. Interested members of the community propose their talks. An editorial panel designated by the organisers makes the selections. The 2019 edition of the conference saw some 303 proposals, of which 36 were selected. CFP applications from the previous years can be seen here. Important Points There are three parallel tracks Talk duration is __30__ mins   CFP closes on 14th August 2020 Schedule shall be released on 1st September 2020 Talks will be presented on 2nd and 3rd October 2020 Workshops Workshops are an important part of the PyCon India. Hands on learning is as important as talks for a fulfilling conference experience. Like talks, workshops are also conducted by the members of the Python community. Anyone can propose for conducting a workshop. Any topic of interest to the Python community is okay - the workshop should help attendees learn a new skill, technology or library. To get a sense of the topics from last year, take a look here. In the CFP proposal, please mention an outline of the workshop and the prerequisites. And the slides if possible. Also mention if you have conducted the same workshop before. The workshop should be interspersed with proper hands-on exercises. After the workshop people should be ramped up on the workshop topic, and should be able to take it forward themselves. To know about Best practices please check the Workshop Proposal Announcement blog post. Important Points Workshop duration is 2.5 hours   CFP closes on 31st August 2020 Schedule shall be released on 15th September 2020 Workshops will be conducted on 4th October 2020 What to Propose Anything of interest to Python programmers is welcome. However, there are a few topics that we feel might be great - Lessons from using Python in your project. Did you find something against conventional wisdom? Something confirming conventional wisdom ? Do you have advise for people solving similar problems? Example - I tried Python for video processing, or in my medical imaging project, and here are the lessons. Something you're doing to make the language/ecosystem better. Writing a library to solve an interesting problem ? Or have some new ideas on optimisation. Something you learned from a different language that may be useful to Python community. How about a type system? Or patterns from functional programming. Or logic programming maybe? Thoughts on tech culture and living. Ideas on improving diversity and inclusiveness. On programmers’ physical and mental health. On getting better at productivity. On workplace issues. Anything that can make an impact, especially if you have used Python for any of the above or have seen someone using Python. And if you don't get any ideas along these lines, try plain and simple teaching. Pick up an niche topic  , and help us learn. A well delivered lecture even at a beginner level is often well received. The Review Process Authors should propose their talks using the CFP application CFP volunteers review the proposals for completeness Once the proposals are ready, they are be reviewed by a panel of experts If the proposal does not look complete, or the reviewers need clarifications, the author is notified via comments The panel of experts finally vote on the proposals A pre-final shortlist is eventually prepared based on the votes The shortlisted proposals go through a round of rehearsals   A final list is created and published. Rehearsals Shortlisted speakers will be expected to participate in rehearsal sessions. Rehearsals will be done via teleconferencing, where the speaker shall give a mock run of their talks in a time-bound manner. The audience will consist of volunteers, reviewers and possibly other speakers. The speakers will be given feedback if necessary. The point of this exercise is to make sure speakers are ready with their talks ahead of time. And also, to make sure they can finish the talk in the stipulated time. It is useful for the speakers too as they'd get feedback on the content delivery and presentation. Participation in the rehearsal sessions is likely to be a required step - chances of an unrehearsed talk making it to the final stage are substantially lower. Diversity We in the Python community believe in making our community more diverse. This means we are encouraging content from diverse walks of life. This also means we want to improve participation from under-represented groups. Our goal is to maximise content from under-represented groups. You can help us by encouraging your friends, family and colleagues to submit talks. You can also help by mentoring. Also note that we have a strict code-of-conduct. This is to make it clear, in intent and practice, that we are committed to making the conference a pleasant, welcoming and harassment free experience for everyone, especially for under-represented groups. Best Practices for Speakers 1. Apply Even if you have a vague idea, submit a proposal. We're available for help with ideas and feedback  . Don't worry about communication skills or English - we are there to help with that too. And our focus is more on the content. 2. Make it detailed Add as much detail as possible to the proposal. Add the presentation slides if you already have one. Add a short minute video giving a summary of the proposal. More detail helps reviewers make better judgement. 3. Propose early We will start the review process as the proposals come in, and not at the end. Proposals submitted early will get more attention and feedback 4. The code of conduct Take a look at the code of conduct, and be mindful of it. The gist is, be nice and avoid using sexist language. 5. Add a preview video Add a small intro video about what your talk is about to provide a preview to what's to be expected. We've put together a set of detailed best practices - take a look. It also contains links to some well written proposals from previous years.

Something you learned from a different language that may be useful to Python community. How about a type system? Or patterns from functional programming. Or logic programming maybe? Thoughts on tech culture and living. Ideas on improving diversity and inclusiveness. On programmers’ physical and mental health. On getting better at productivity. On workplace issues. Anything that can make an impact, especially if you have used Python for any of the above or have seen someone using Python. And if you don't get any ideas along these lines, try plain and simple teaching. Pick up an niche topic  , and help us learn. A well delivered lecture even at a beginner level is often well received. The Review Process Authors should propose their talks using the CFP application CFP volunteers review the proposals for completeness Once the proposals are ready, they are be reviewed by a panel of experts If the proposal does not look complete, or the reviewers need clarifications, the author is notified via comments The panel of experts finally vote on the proposals A pre-final shortlist is eventually prepared based on the votes The shortlisted proposals go through a round of rehearsals   A final list is created and published. Rehearsals Shortlisted speakers will be expected to participate in rehearsal sessions. Rehearsals will be done via teleconferencing, where the speaker shall give a mock run of their talks in a time-bound manner. The audience will consist of volunteers, reviewers and possibly other speakers. The speakers will be given feedback if necessary. The point of this exercise is to make sure speakers are ready with their talks ahead of time. And also, to make sure they can finish the talk in the stipulated time. It is useful for the speakers too as they'd get feedback on the content delivery and presentation. Participation in the rehearsal sessions is likely to be a required step - chances of an unrehearsed talk making it to the final stage are substantially lower. Diversity We in the Python community believe in making our community more diverse. This means we are encouraging content from diverse walks of life. This also means we want to improve participation from under-represented groups. Our goal is to maximise content from under-represented groups. You can help us by encouraging your friends, family and colleagues to submit talks. You can also help by mentoring. Also note that we have a strict code-of-conduct. This is to make it clear, in intent and practice, that we are committed to making the conference a pleasant, welcoming and harassment free experience for everyone, especially for under-represented groups. Best Practices for Speakers 1. Apply Even if you have a vague idea, submit a proposal. We're available for help with ideas and feedback  . Don't worry about communication skills or English - we are there to help with that too. And our focus is more on the content. 2. Make it detailed Add as much detail as possible to the proposal. Add the presentation slides if you already have one. Add a short minute video giving a summary of the proposal. More detail helps reviewers make better judgement. 3. Propose early We will start the review process as the proposals come in, and not at the end. Proposals submitted early will get more attention and feedback 4. The code of conduct Take a look at the code of conduct, and be mindful of it. The gist is, be nice and avoid using sexist language. 5. Add a preview video Add a small intro video about what your talk is about to provide a preview to what's to be expected. We've put together a set of detailed best practices - take a look. It also contains links to some well written proposals from previous years.

Info: Devsprint 2019 proposals Toggle navigation Devsprint 2019 Login / Register Devsprint 2019 Proposals 16 Jul - 30 Sep, 2019 Proposal submission closed PyCon India is a place for developers from across the country   to get together and celebrate Python. But what good is a PyCon without getting your hands dirty writing some code? Hence, for all Open Source enthusiasts out there, the PyCon India team is happy to announce Devsprints @ PyCon India 2019. During Devsprints, mentors/contributors of OSS projects guide participants through the end-to-end process of OSS contribution, right from setting up build environments, to developing and testing code, to submitting patches for bugs. If you are stuck, mentors are all available to help you figure out issues and get you back up and running! From past experiences, we’ve seen a lot of people start off contributing to OSS through Devsprints and later go on to become regular contributors to various projects across the web. If you are a contributor or have been involved in maintenance of any Open source project, please come forward and add a project. This project can be any interesting Open source project which is based on Python. Ideally, you should have a history with the project through previous code commits. Your responsibility will be to help your team set up their development environment, list out beginner friendly bugs, and guide them on any problems they face during the event. Any maintainer is welcome to add a project. There will be no shortlisting of projects. We are using the CFP platform to make it easier to manage and keep the projects at one place.

Info: Posters 2019 proposals Toggle navigation Posters 2019 Login / Register Posters 2019 Proposals 03 Jun - 03 Sep, 2019 Proposal submission closed Posters for PyCon India 2019 Posters are graphical summary of projects or ideas. They are usually presented with an A0 size poster, but any creative ways are always welcome. The poster session provides an opportunity to network with the conference attendees and acts as a starting point for further discussions. While talks generally needs to appeal to a wide section of the community, posters can cover niche topics. PyCon India 2019 will be having a poster presentation session at post lunch, day 1. During the poster presentation session you will be provided with a poster board that can hold an A0 size poster, and a table to place your laptop, for demos. Conference attendees interested in your topic, will stop by, during which you can give them a brief presentation / demo. Timeline Poster CFP opens: 3rd June, 2019 Poster CFP closes: 3rd September, 2019 Selected posters announced: 14th September, 2019 Draft posters to be submitted On: 15th September, 2019 Posters will be presented on: 12th October, 2019 FAQ What is the difference between a talk and a poster? Talks and posters are different ways of interacting with the conference audience. A topic can be presented as talk, if the intention is to explain the topic in detail. A poster on the other hand, is similar to a lightning talk, in that it quickly introduces the audience to a topic, and acts as trigger point for further discussion. There are some specific cases where posters are better suited than talks: Due to the nature of the poster presentation format, it is better suited for demos, the attendees can interact with the project. This is especially useful for hardware projects. If you are first time conference attendee, or a first time speaker at a conference, posters let you engage with the audience without getting intimidated by the large crowd. Niche topics that are domain heavy, are better suited as posters. Examples: Python in local language computing, Python in embedded Linux build automation, Python used in scientific study of ailments, etc. Can I submit both a talk and a poster proposal? You can submit a talk and poster proposal for the same topic. If your talk does not get selected, you can use the poster session, to introduce your topic, and engage with the audience. Given the limited space and time at the conference, only one of them will get selected though. What makes a good poster? First, ensure that you select a good title. Conference attendees will use it to determine which posters to attend. Make sure it brings in audience who will be interested in your poster. Second, for the poster itself, here are a few tips for creating the poster: While textual representation is good, graphical representation will attract more eyes Make sure the contents are properly sized and spaced in the poster so that it is viewable from decent distance Provoke the reader's curiosity which will open up space for further discussions Provide links for the attendees to know more about the topic and connect with you / the community Do you have sample poster proposals to get started? You can check the poster proposals from other conferences: PySangamam 2018 PyCon US 2019 Can I do a poster in a local language? Yes! Since attendees can choose which poster they want to attend, your poster can be in a local language. This makes sense only if there will be sufficient no. of participants who are familiar with the language. This can also be done, if the topic is itself about projects / libraries on regional language computing. Please be noted that the proposal itself needs to be in English, for the reviewers to be able to comprehend your proposal.

Hands on learning is as important as talks for a fulfilling conference experience. Like talks, workshops are also conducted by the members of the Python community. To streamline the selection of topics for the workshops, we use a process similar to the Talks CFP. Here are some notable points about workshops at PyConIndia 2019: CFP Opens: 3rd May CFP Closes: 1st July Schedule Announcement: 1st August Presented on: 14th October Venue: IITM Research Park Six workshops across three tracks Duration: 2.5 hours Up to 40 attendees per workshop Anyone can propose for conducting a workshop. Any topic of interest to the Python community is okay - the workshop should help attendees learn a new skill, technology or library. To get a sense of the topics from last year, take a look here. All the facilities needed to conduct the workshop will be provided. This includes plug points, projectors etc. Attendees will be bringing their own laptops. In the CFP proposal, please mention an outline of the workshop and the prerequisites. And the slides if possible. Also mention if you have conducted the same workshop before. The workshop should be interspersed with proper hands-on exercises. After the workshop people should be ramped up on the workshop topic, and should be able to take it forward themselves.

Info: Talks 2019 proposals Toggle navigation Talks 2019 Login / Register Talks 2019 Proposals 30 Mar - 01 Jul, 2019 Proposal submission closed Welcome to PyCon India CFP Technical talks are the most important event at PyCon India, the core of the conference essentially. Two of the four days are dedicated to talks. Talks are short lectures   supported by a presentation. Speakers come from the Python community. Talks are selected through a CFP   process. Interested members of the community propose their talks. An editorial panel designated by the organizers makes the selections. The 2018 edition of the conference saw some 267 proposals, of which 31 were selected. CFP applications from the previous years can be seen here. Salient Points There are __three parallel tracks__ Talk duration is __30 mins__   CFP closes on __1st July 2019__ Schedule shall be released on __1st September 2019__ Talks will be presented on __12th and 13th October 2019__ What to Propose Anything of interest to Python programmers is welcome. However, there are a few topics that we feel might be great - Lessons from using Python in your project. Did you find something against conventional wisdom? Something confirming conventional wisdom ? Do you have advise for people solving similar problems? Eg - I tried Python for video processing, or in my medical imaging project, and here are the lessions. Something you're doing to make the language/ecosystem better. Writing a library to solve an interesting problem ? Or have some new ideas on optimization. Something you learned from a different language that may be useful to Python community. How about a type system? Or patterns from functional programming. Or logic programming maybe? Thoughts on tech culture and living. Ideas on improving diversity and inclusiveness. On programmers’ physical and mental health. On getting better at productivity. On workplace issues. Anything that can make an impact, especially if you have used Python for any of the above or have seen someone using Python. And if you don't get any ideas along these lines, try plain and simple teaching. Pick up an niche topic  , and help us learn. A well delivered lecture even at a beginner level is often well received. The Review Process Authors should propose their talks using the CFP application CFP volunteers review the proposals for completeness Once the proposals are ready, they are be reviewed by a panel of experts If the proposal does not look complete, or the reviewers need clarifications, the author is notified via comments The panel of experts finally vote on the proposals A pre-final shortlist is eventually prepared based on the votes The shortlisted proposals go through a round of rehearsals   A final list is created and published. Rehearsals Shortlisted speakers will be expected to participate in rehearsal sessions. Rehearsals will be done via teleconferencing, where the speaker shall give a mock run of their talks in a time-bound manner. The audience will consist of volunteers, reviewers and possibly other speakers. The speakers will be given feedback if necessary. The point of this exercise is to make sure speakers are ready with their talks ahead of time. And also, to make sure they can finish the talk in the stipulated time. It is useful for the speakers too as they'd get feedback on the content delivery and presentation. Participation in the rehearsal sessions is likely to be a required step - chances of an unrehearsed talk making it to the final stage are substantially lower. Diversity We in the Python community believe in making our community more diverse. This means we are encouraging content from diverse walks of life. This also means we want to improve participation from under-represented groups. Our goal is to maximise content from under-represented groups. You can help us by encouraging your friends, family and colleagues to submit talks. You can also help by mentoring. Also note that we have a strict code-of-conduct. This is to make it clear, in intent and practice, that we are committed to making the conference a pleasant, welcoming and harassment free experience for everyone, especially for under-represented groups. Best Practices for Speakers 1. Apply Even if you have a vague idea, submit a proposal. We're available for help with ideas and feedback  . Don't worry about communication skills or English - we are there to help with that too. And our focus is more on the content. 2. Make it detailed Add as much detail as possible to the proposal. Add the presentation slides if you already have one. Add a short minute video giving a summary of the proposal. More detail helps reviewers make better judgement. 3. Propose early We will start the review process as the proposals come in, and not at the end. Proposals submitted early will get more attention and feedback 4. The code of conduct Take a look at the code of conduct, and be mindful of it. The gist is, be nice and avoid using sexist language. We've put together a set of detailed best practices - take a look. It also contains links to some well written proposals from previous years.

But what good is a PyCon without getting your hands dirty writing some code? Hence, for all Open Source enthusiasts out there, the PyCon India team is happy to announce Dev Sprints @ PyCon India 2018. Have you always wanted to get started with contributing to Open Source Software   but simply don’t know where to start? Are you an experienced OSS contributor looking for projects that could use your help? Are you the maintainer/contributor of an OSS project and need help with fixing bugs and/or managing the project? If you answered “Yes!” to any of the above, then Dev Sprints are here for you! During Dev sprints, Mentors/Contributors of OSS projects guide participants through the end to end process of OSS contribution, right from setting up build environments, to developing and testing code, to submitting patches for bugs. If you are stuck, mentors are all available to help you figure out issues and get you back up and running! From past experiences, we’ve seen a lot of people start off contributing to OSS through Dev Sprints and later go on to become regular contributors to various projects across the web. If you are a contributor or have been involved in maintenance of any Open source project, please come forward and add a project. This project can be any interesting Open source project which is based on Python. Ideally, you should have a history with the project through previous code commits. Your responsibility will be to help your team set up their development environment, list out beginner friendly bugs, and guide them on any problems they face during the event. Any maintainer is Welcome to Add a project. There will be no shortlisting of projects. We are using the CFP platform to make it easier to manage and keep the projects at one place.

How to write a proposal If you have an idea   and want to speak, here’s a very rough process of what you should do next: Brainstorm or mind map to expand upon your ideas or knowledge in search of a general topic Write a paragraph or two, or some bullet points, to outline the core concepts you want to communicate and what people might learn from your talk Get someone you trust to read your notes and tell you what they think they’d learn Ask one of our mentors for help with building up your submission Practice! This public speaking repository, maintained by VM Brasseur, has many useful resources to help you polish your proposals and talks. Code of Conduct All speakers will be expected to have read and adhere to the conference Code of Conduct, listed below and also at our website. In particular for speakers: slide contents and spoken material should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate, and neither are language or imagery that denigrate or demean people based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability, or body size. Mentors Presenters, regardless of experience, sometimes want a little help. If you’d like any help in proposing, preparing, or presenting your talk, feel free to contact one of our mentors! A mentor is an experienced presenter who has volunteered to help other presenters. If you are a first-time speaker, or looking for help to give a shape to the idea that you have in your mind, or just appreciate another set of eyes, our mentors are here to help. If you would like to be matched with a mentor to help with your proposal , request a mentor here.

Format The format of each talk will be up to the speaker but should include a mix of lectures, demos, and Q&A. Workshops These are 3-hour-long interactive sessions where attendees can learn by doing. Hands-on learning is as important as talks for a fulfilling conference experience. Like talks, workshops are also conducted by the members of the Python community. Anyone can propose conducting a workshop. Any topic of interest to the Python community is okay - the workshop should help attendees learn a new skill, technology, or library. To get a sense of the topics from last year, take a look here. In the CFP proposal, please mention an outline of the workshop and the prerequisites and the slides if possible. Also, mention if you have conducted the same workshop before. The workshop should be interspersed with proper hands-on exercises. After the workshop people should be ramped up on the workshop topic and should be able to take it forward themselves. To know about Best practices please check the Workshop Proposal Announcement blog post. Important Points Workshop duration is 3 hours   CFP closes on 9th June 2024 Schedule shall be released on 1st September 2024 Workshops will be conducted on 20th September 2024 We may have up to 3 parallel tracks of workshops in each session. The morning session will run from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The evening session will run from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Format Workshops are aimed at beginner, intermediate, and advanced experience-level participants. Workshop proposals must include a detailed outline of the covered topics and allocated time. Important Dates CFP for Talks and Workshop Open on 10th March 2024 and closes on 9th June 2024. What to Propose Anything of interest to Python programmers is welcome. However, there are a few topics that we feel might be great - Lessons from using Python in your project. Did you find something against conventional wisdom? Something confirming conventional wisdom? Do you have advice for people solving similar problems? Example - I tried Python for video processing, or in my medical imaging project, and here are the lessons. Something you're doing to make the language/ecosystem better. Writing a library to solve an interesting problem? Or have some new ideas on optimization. Something you learned from a different language that may be useful to the Python community. How about a type system? Or patterns from functional programming. Or logic programming maybe? Thoughts on tech culture and living. Ideas on improving diversity and inclusiveness. On programmers’ physical and mental health. On getting better at productivity. On workplace issues. Anything that can make an impact, especially if you have used Python for any of the above or have seen someone using Python. And if you don't get any ideas along these lines, try plain and simple teaching. Pick up a niche topic  , and help us learn. A well-delivered lecture even at a beginner level is often well-received. The Review Process Authors should propose their talks using the CFP application CFP volunteers review the proposals for completeness Once the proposals are ready, they are reviewed by a panel of experts If the proposal does not look complete, or the reviewers need clarifications, the author is notified via comments The panel of experts finally vote on the proposals A pre-final shortlist is eventually prepared based on the votes The shortlisted proposals go through a round of rehearsals   A final list is created and published. Rehearsals Shortlisted speakers will be expected to participate in rehearsal sessions. Rehearsals will be done via teleconferencing, where the speaker shall give a mock run of their talks in a time-bound manner. The audience will consist of volunteers, reviewers, and possibly other speakers. The speakers will be given feedback if necessary. The point of this exercise is to make sure speakers are ready with their talks ahead of time. And also, to make sure they can finish the talk in the stipulated time. It is useful for the speakers too as they'd get feedback on the content delivery and presentation. Participation in the rehearsal sessions is likely to be a required step - chances of an unrehearsed talk making it to the final stage are substantially lower. Diversity We in the Python community believe in making our community more diverse. This means we are encouraging content from diverse walks of life. This also means we want to improve participation from under-represented groups. Our goal is to maximize content from under-represented groups. You can help us by encouraging your friends, family, and colleagues to submit talks. You can also help by mentoring. Also note that we have a strict code-of-conduct. This is to make it clear, in intent and practice, that we are committed to making the conference a pleasant, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone, especially for under-represented groups. Best Practices for Speakers 1. Apply Even if you have a vague idea, submit a proposal. We're available for help with ideas and feedback  . Don't worry about communication skills or English - we are there to help with that too. And our focus is more on the content. 2. Make it detailed Add as much detail as possible to the proposal. Add the presentation slides if you already have one. Add a short minute video giving a summary of the proposal. More detail helps reviewers make better judgments. 3. Propose early We will start the review process as the proposals come in, and not at the end. Proposals submitted early will get more attention and feedback 4. The code of conduct Take a look at the code of conduct, and be mindful of it. The gist is, to be nice and avoid using sexist language. 5. Add a preview video Add a small intro video about what your talk is about to provide a preview to what's to be expected. We've put together a set of detailed best practices - take a look. It also contains links to some well-written proposals from previous years.

Info: PyCon India 2024, Bangaluru Home Schedule Code of Conduct Blog FAQ We're back for 2024! and the Call for Proposals is open!! Published: March 10, 2024 Author: Nikhil Maan   We are excited to announce that PyCon India 2024 is back in Bengaluru and the call for proposals is officially open! We are looking for proposals on a wide range of topics. We look forward to seeing beginner, intermediate, and advanced proposals on diverse topics from speakers of different expertise and experience. To submit a proposal, you don't need to be a veteran who has spoken at a dozen conferences in the past. We are looking for all kinds of people to make our conference genuinely diverse. That's what our community comprises, and that's what this conference's schedule should be genuinely made of. So, whether you are submitting a proposal for talks for the first time or just want to share what you have been doing with Python for a long time, this is YOUR time to shine! Please make a note of some important dates as mentioned below: CFP opens on 10th March 2024 CFP closes on 31st May 2024 The schedule shall be released on 1st September 2024 Talks will be presented on 21st - 22nd September 2024 Workshops are on 20th September 2024 Where can you submit your proposal? Read the call for proposals editorial for more information on writing proposals. Next, after signing up for an account, start drafting your proposal in the New Proposal page. Do make sure to read the best practices before submitting your proposals, especially if you are a first-time speaker! Guide to writing excellent proposals As you think about the experiences, skills, and knowledge you want to bring, We would also like you to focus on the proposal you submit. A well-thought-out proposal could mean a chance to be selected and presented at PyCon India 2024. Take your time to go through our team's advice on preparing a kickass proposal that turns heads: When submitting a proposal, you must fill in the following details. Title Give your talk/workshop a name that accurately describes the session's focus for potential attendees. Description A brief description of the talk/workshop is needed here. Provide as much detail as possible to guide us through your plans to cover the topic. The workshop should last 3 hours, and the talk should last 30 minutes. Hence, a rough timeline detailing how you will spend time explaining the concept would be great. Audience Level At what level of Python and other topic-specific experience or expertise is the workshop aiming for? We realize this may be too narrow for a seminar; for example, if the workshop is aimed at experienced programmers but novices to Python, give it your best shot. Reviewers need to know what level of Python experience is targeted and what level  of domain-specific expertise is targeted, such as networking, SQL, database, etc. Prerequisites There may be preferences or requirements regarding your talk/workshop that attendees need to consider before joining in. Video URL Preview videos: Do you discuss your proposal and topics you intend to cover in your talk/workshop, and how do you plan to cover them? Participants are strongly suggested to upload links to their preview videos while submitting their proposals. You can check the guidelines for creating a preview video in the following section. Speaker Info You'll be asked to enter your biography, and the information will be made public. Here, you may include more information for reviewers to complement information about your previous experience. This can include your subject matter experience, past workshops, past speaking events, or anything else to help us understand and gauge your abilities as a workshop presenter. A link to a video would be ideal   Guidelines for creating Preview Video Preview videos Are you talking about your proposal, topics you intend to cover in the talk, and how you plan to cover them? Participants are strongly suggested to upload links to their preview videos while submitting their proposals. It will be immensely helpful for reviewers to review preview videos and consider them before making final decisions on your talk proposal. Please keep in mind to strictly follow all guidelines for creating your video preview as mentioned below:- Duration & orientation A 1-3 minute video to be recorded, preferably in portrait mode. Upload to YouTube The video must be uploaded on YouTube. If you want to prevent others from finding it, mark it unlisted. Don't mark it as private or disallow embedding, or we won't be able to see it. ​ Only you talking about your talk The video should contain nothing except you talking about your talk.​ Try to make a video that holds our attention and helps us understand your talk more deeply. No effects & No Music Please do not add background music to your video, use screenshots, or use post-production wizardry; we don't want this to become a video-making contest. If you're going to spend time making something cool, put that into your slides and proposal instead. No Script Please do not recite a script written beforehand. Just talk spontaneously as you would to a friend. People delivering memorized speeches   usually come off as dull and uninspiring. Consider this a fun activity, and let your heart do the talking. Be vanilla! Check your Audio Keep your voice clear and check that it's being recorded properly. Make sure there isn't any background noise. Record this in an empty room without much going on in the background. Have any more questions? We are here to help! Feel free to ping us on Zulip or contact the coordinators through email: The team: cfp@in.pycon.org We look forward to seeing your proposals in our inboxes in the coming months!

Info: PyCon India 2023 proposals Toggle navigation PyCon India 2023 Login / Register PyCon India 2023 Proposals 29 Sep - 02 Oct, 2023 Proposal submission closed Welcome to PyCon India 2023 CFP Join us for PyCon India 2023, the 14th edition of the premier Python conference in India, taking place in the vibrant city of Hyderabad from September 29 to October 2. This annual gathering brings together Python enthusiasts, developers, and industry professionals for four days of inspiring Talks, hands-on Workshops, and networking opportunities. Visit the official website for more information: https://in.pycon.org/2023/ Talks Talks should be 30 minutes long   and can be on any topic related to Python. Schedule Talks will be there across the morning and evening sessions on September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2023,. We may have up to 3 parallel tracks of talks in each session. The morning session will run from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The evening session will run from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Format The format of each talk will be up to the speaker but should include a mix of lectures, demos, and Q&A. Workshops Workshops are 3 hrs long interactive sessions where attendees can learn by doing. Schedule Workshops will be held on September 29, 2023, across two morning and evening sessions. We may have up to 3 parallel tracks of workshops in each session. The morning session will run from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The evening session will run from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Format Workshops are aimed at beginner, intermediate, and advanced experience-level participants. Workshop proposals must include a detailed outline of the covered topics and allocated time. Important Dates CFP for Talks and Workshop closes on August 5. Selected Talks and Workshops will be announced on September 4. What to Propose Any topics of interest to Python programmers, with a focus on the following: Lessons learned from using Python in projects, including unconventional and conventional wisdom and advice for similar problem-solving. E.g., I tried Python for video processing or in my medical imaging project, and here are the lessons. Contributions to improving the Python language/ecosystem, such as creating libraries or proposing optimizations. Knowledge gained from other languages, like type systems, functional programming patterns, or logic programming. Thoughts on tech culture, diversity and inclusiveness, the physical and mental health of programmers, productivity improvement, workplace issues, and their impact when using Python. Alternatively, consider offering teaching sessions on niche topics, recent technologies, or scientific papers, even at a beginner level. Rehearsals Shortlisted speakers will be expected to participate in rehearsal sessions. We will conduct Rehearsals via teleconferencing, where the speaker shall give a mock run of their talks in a time-bound manner. The audience will include volunteers, reviewers, and possibly other speakers. We will give feedback to speakers if necessary. This exercise aims to ensure speakers are ready with their talks beforehand. And also to ensure they can finish the talk within the stipulated time. It is also helpful for the speakers to get feedback on the content delivery and presentation. Participation in the rehearsal sessions is likely to be required - chances of an unrehearsed talk making it to the final stage are substantially lower. Diversity We in the Python community believe in making our community more diverse. This suggests that we encourage content from diverse walks of life and also want to improve participation from under-represented groups. Our goal is to maximize content from under-represented groups. You can help us by encouraging your friends, family, and colleagues to submit talks. You can also help by mentoring. Also, note that we have a strict code of conduct. In intent and practice, we are committed to making the conference a pleasant, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone, especially for under-represented groups. Speaker Best Practices We've compiled a set of detailed best practices - take a look. Questions? Ping us on Zulip.

Info: PyCon India 2023 proposals Toggle navigation PyCon India 2023 Login / Register PyCon India 2023 Proposals 29 Sep - 02 Oct, 2023 Proposal submission closed Welcome to PyCon India 2023 CFP Join us for PyCon India 2023, the 14th edition of the premier Python conference in India, taking place in the vibrant city of Hyderabad from September 29 to October 2. This annual gathering brings together Python enthusiasts, developers, and industry professionals for four days of inspiring Talks, hands-on Workshops, and networking opportunities. Visit the official website for more information: https://in.pycon.org/2023/ Talks Talks should be 30 minutes long   and can be on any topic related to Python. Schedule Talks will be there across the morning and evening sessions on September 30, 2023, and October 1, 2023,. We may have up to 3 parallel tracks of talks in each session. The morning session will run from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The evening session will run from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Format The format of each talk will be up to the speaker but should include a mix of lectures, demos, and Q&A. Workshops Workshops are 3 hrs long interactive sessions where attendees can learn by doing. Schedule Workshops will be held on September 29, 2023, across two morning and evening sessions. We may have up to 3 parallel tracks of workshops in each session. The morning session will run from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The evening session will run from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Format Workshops are aimed at beginner, intermediate, and advanced experience-level participants. Workshop proposals must include a detailed outline of the covered topics and allocated time. Important Dates CFP for Talks and Workshop closes on August 5. Selected Talks and Workshops will be announced on September 4. What to Propose Any topics of interest to Python programmers, with a focus on the following: Lessons learned from using Python in projects, including unconventional and conventional wisdom and advice for similar problem-solving. E.g., I tried Python for video processing or in my medical imaging project, and here are the lessons. Contributions to improving the Python language/ecosystem, such as creating libraries or proposing optimizations. Knowledge gained from other languages, like type systems, functional programming patterns, or logic programming. Thoughts on tech culture, diversity and inclusiveness, the physical and mental health of programmers, productivity improvement, workplace issues, and their impact when using Python. Alternatively, consider offering teaching sessions on niche topics, recent technologies, or scientific papers, even at a beginner level. Rehearsals Shortlisted speakers will be expected to participate in rehearsal sessions. We will conduct Rehearsals via teleconferencing, where the speaker shall give a mock run of their talks in a time-bound manner. The audience will include volunteers, reviewers, and possibly other speakers. We will give feedback to speakers if necessary. This exercise aims to ensure speakers are ready with their talks beforehand. And also to ensure they can finish the talk within the stipulated time. It is also helpful for the speakers to get feedback on the content delivery and presentation. Participation in the rehearsal sessions is likely to be required - chances of an unrehearsed talk making it to the final stage are substantially lower. Diversity We in the Python community believe in making our community more diverse. This suggests that we encourage content from diverse walks of life and also want to improve participation from under-represented groups. Our goal is to maximize content from under-represented groups. You can help us by encouraging your friends, family, and colleagues to submit talks. You can also help by mentoring. Also, note that we have a strict code of conduct. In intent and practice, we are committed to making the conference a pleasant, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone, especially for under-represented groups. Speaker Best Practices We've compiled a set of detailed best practices - take a look. Questions? Ping us on Zulip.

The conversational engine is designed to engage with users in several languages, at least in the order of tens. Solving this problem was non-trivial. There were learnings from different challenges while deploying this engine to production. In this talk, we will discuss the development and deployment of a multilingual virtual assistant for Indian languages using a Python-based framework, while crafting the assistants' responses with dynamic data integration   for user's queries and   at assistant's own initiation. We designed a language-agnostic natural language understanding   pipeline for the conversational engine, using which the virtual assistant 'understands' customer queries in multiple languages. The dialog flow for the conversational engine was designed by envisioning potential engagement scenarios in customer support. Custom responses from the engine are crafted in multiple forms, with integration of user-specific systems of records. This enables the virtual assistant to ‘respond’ to customer queries with an evolutionary conversational flow in a personalized manner. Our efforts in developing this multilingual virtual assistant have resulted in 97% NLU accuracy in benchmark measurements, and the deployed version attracted 93% of 'Happy' feedback rating from customers expressing their satisfaction. Outline of the talk   Introduction   How the conversational assistant understands queries in multiple languages   How the conversational assistant generates custom responses   Challenges in going to production : examples from real-life scenarios   Solutions for addressing these challenges and monitoring on prod   Q/A   Takeaways Learn about a language-agnostic multilingual NLU process pipeline Insights into data-conditions that aid multilingual conversational engines Understand challenges in deploying such an engine in production Addressing dynamic nature of dialogue flow and personalized response generation Periodic monitoring and feedback Prerequisites: Basic understanding of machine learning Video URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TsSV3Idx3rYUMnulfKgJr1m9Aq1UrsGe/view?usp=drive_link Speaker

JSON and XML formats are widely used for API and message-based communication but have poor support for running different versions of applications at the same time apart from their average performance in storage and communication. Alternative binary encoding formats exist namely Avro, Thrift, and Protobuf but there is little awareness about them. These formats provide superior support on application forward and backward compatibility requirements and improved performance on storage and communication. But they also come with their own set of overheads and are not always the best fit for all our application implementation use cases. The talk aims to sensitize techies on these different types of encoding formats, their data encoding strategies, the impact on the performance of storage, and data communication speeds and application compatibility issues. To validate the above points the results of benchmarking these encoding formats for speed and storage metrics using a Python Based Application Performance Monitoring tool - Locust would be shared. Armed with this knowledge choosing the right encoding formats in the context of the use cases would be easy Prerequisites: JSON and XML Formats What Schemas are? Content URLs: Slides Speaker

Info: Harnessing the Power of Django StreamingHttpResponse for Efficient Web Streaming   PyCon India 2023 Toggle navigation PyCon India 2023 Login / Register PyCon India 2023 Proposals Harnessing the Power of Django StreamingHttpResponse for Efficient Web Streaming Harnessing the Power of Django StreamingHttpResponse for Efficient Web Streaming Shivam Chaurasia     19 Jun, 2023 1 Vote Description: Title: Harnessing the Power of Django StreamingHttpResponse for Efficient Web Streaming Introduction: In the world of web development, streaming data has become increasingly popular. Whether it's live video feeds, real-time analytics, or large file downloads, streaming allows for efficient and seamless transmission of data over the web. Django, a high-level Python web framework, provides a powerful tool called StreamingHttpResponse that enables developers to implement streaming functionalities with ease. In this blog post, we will explore the capabilities of Django StreamingHttpResponse and discuss how it can enhance your web applications. What is Django StreamingHttpResponse? Django StreamingHttpResponse is a class-based response that streams content to the client in chunks rather than waiting for the entire response to be generated. It allows you to iterate over a generator function or any other iterable, sending chunks of data to the client as they become available. This is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or long-running processes, as it avoids buffering the entire response in memory. Implementing StreamingHttpResponse: To use StreamingHttpResponse, you need to create a generator function or an iterable that generates the content you want to stream. Let's take a look at a simple example to illustrate the concept: ```python from django.http import StreamingHttpResponse def stream_data : # Generate data in chunks for i in range : yield f"Data chunk  \n" # Simulate delay between chunks time.sleep  def streaming_view : response = StreamingHttpResponse ) response  = 'text/plain' return response ``` In the code above, we define a generator function called stream_data  that yields data chunks. We then create a StreamingHttpResponse object by passing the generator function as the content argument. Finally, we set the appropriate Content-Type header and return the response. StreamingHttpResponse for streaming real-time stock market data Let's dive into a more sophisticated example of using Django's StreamingHttpResponse for streaming real-time stock market data to clients. ```python from django.http import StreamingHttpResponse from channels.layers import get_channel_layer from asgiref.sync import async_to_sync import json import time def generate_stock_data : # Connect to a real-time stock data source   # Iterate and yield stock data in chunks while True: stock_data = get_real_time_stock_data  yield json.dumps  # Simulate delay between data updates time.sleep  def stream_stock_data : channel_layer = get_channel_layer  stream_name = "stock_data_stream" def send_stock_data : for stock_data in generate_stock_data : async_to_sync   # Yield the data for streaming response as well yield stock_data response = StreamingHttpResponse , content_type="application/json") # Open a channel to stream data to clients via WebSocket or other streaming protocols async_to_sync   def handle_disconnect : # Cleanup and close the channel when the client disconnects async_to_sync   response.streaming_content.disconnect = handle_disconnect return response ``` In this example, we assume that you have set up Django Channels to handle WebSocket communication. Here's how the example works: We define a generate_stock_data  function that connects to a real-time stock data source   and yields JSON-encoded stock data in chunks. In the stream_stock_data  view function, we obtain the channel_layer to handle WebSocket communication. Inside the send_stock_data  generator function, we iterate over the generated stock data and send it to the client via WebSocket using the group_send  method. We also yield the stock data for the streaming response. We create a StreamingHttpResponse object with send_stock_data  as the content. We set the content type to "application/json" to indicate that the response contains JSON-encoded data. We add the client's WebSocket channel to the stock_data_stream group using group_add . This allows us to send stock data updates to all clients subscribed to the stream. We define a handle_disconnect  function that gets called when the client disconnects. Inside this function, we remove the client's WebSocket channel from the stock_data_stream group using group_discard . We assign the handle_disconnect  function to response.streaming_content.disconnect so that it gets called when the client disconnects. By implementing this example, you can provide real-time stock data updates to clients, allowing them to receive and process the data as it becomes available. The use of Django's StreamingHttpResponse and Django Channels facilitates the seamless streaming of data and enhances the overall user experience in real-time stock market monitoring applications. EventStream in StreamingHttpResponse Let's combine the concepts of Event Stream and StreamingHttpResponse to create a real-time event stream using Django. ```python from django.http import StreamingHttpResponse def generate_events : # Connect to an event source or database # Retrieve and yield events in chunks while True: events = get_real_time_events  for event in events: yield f"data:  \n\n" # Simulate delay between event updates time.sleep  def event_stream : def stream_events : for event in generate_events : yield event response = StreamingHttpResponse , content_type='text/event-stream') response  = 'no-cache' response  = 'chunked' return response ``` In this example, we assume you have a source   from which you can retrieve real-time events. Here's how the example works: We define a generate_events  generator function that connects to the event source or database and yields events in chunks. Each event is formatted as an Event Stream line with a "data" field. Inside the event_stream  view function, we define a stream_events  generator function that iterates over the generated events and yields them. We create a StreamingHttpResponse object with stream_events  as the content and set the content type to "text/event-stream" to indicate that we are streaming an Event Stream. We set the appropriate response headers: Cache-Control is set to "no-cache" to ensure that the response is not cached, and Transfer-Encoding is set to "chunked" to enable streaming. Finally, we return the StreamingHttpResponse object as the response. By implementing this example, you can create a real-time event stream where clients can connect and receive event updates as they occur. This approach is particularly useful for applications such as real-time chat systems, live feeds, or activity streams where users need to be continuously informed about the latest events. Advantages of StreamingHttpResponse: 1. Memory Efficiency: StreamingHttpResponse streams data in chunks, which reduces the memory footprint compared to buffering the entire response. This makes it ideal for scenarios involving large datasets or files. Improved User Experience: Streaming responses provide a better user experience for long-running processes or when dealing with large files. Instead of waiting for the entire content to load, users can start consuming data as it becomes available. Real-Time Data Streaming: Django's StreamingHttpResponse enables real-time data streaming, making it suitable for applications like live video feeds, chat applications, or real-time analytics. Clients can receive data updates as soon as they are available. Scalability: By avoiding the need to buffer the entire response, StreamingHttpResponse allows your application to handle multiple concurrent streaming requests more efficiently. This scalability is crucial for applications that serve a high volume of users or deal with heavy data processing. Considerations and Best Practices: While Django's StreamingHttpResponse provides powerful streaming capabilities, there are some considerations and best practices to keep in mind: Chunk Size: The size of each data chunk should be optimized based on your use case and the client's network conditions. Very small chunks may lead to inefficient data transmission, while excessively large chunks may result in delays or connection timeouts. Compression: If streaming large amounts of text-based data, enabling compression can significantly reduce the bandwidth requirements and improve overall performance. Django supports various compression options that can be applied to the response. Web Server Compatibility: StreamingHttpResponse works best with web servers that support streaming, such as Gunicorn or uWSGI. Ensure that your chosen server is compatible with streaming responses to leverage the full benefits. Conclusion: Django StreamingHttpResponse is a powerful tool that empowers developers to efficiently implement streaming functionalities in their web applications. Whether you are dealing with large datasets, real-time data updates, or long-running processes, StreamingHttpResponse offers an elegant solution that optimizes memory usage and enhances user experience. By utilizing this feature, you can unlock the potential for scalable, real-time streaming in your Django projects, opening up a wide range of possibilities for innovative and interactive web applications.

Info: The programmers guide to timestamps and timezones   PyCon India 2023 Toggle navigation PyCon India 2023 Login / Register PyCon India 2023 Proposals The programmers guide to timestamps and timezones The programmers guide to timestamps and timezones Shrayas Rajagopal     22 Jul, 2023 1 Vote Description: Problem There are 24 different timezones in the world. And about 70 countries observe daylight savings times. As developers, we have to develop applications that are able to store timestamps generated from anywhere in the world, be it in the past or in the future. Additionally we also have to keep the code and database updated with any changes being made to the timezones and react to those accordingly. And timezone information changes quite often. For example, in 2022, we had 7 changes to the timezone database. Most of us when asked what timezone we are in, would respond with “IST” but you know that IST isn’t a standardized timezone and can actually refer to Indian Standard Time, Israel Standard Time or Irish Standard Time. How do we handle this in the system? For countries that observe DST  , when the clocks move forward, an entire hour is usually skipped and when they move backward, an hour occurs twice. So on a move forward day, an appointment scheduled for 3:00PM might actually be an invalid time. And on a move backward day, an appointment scheduled for 3:00PM might occur twice. How do we handle this in the system? One quick answer, given that all times in the world can be converted into UTC, would be to say “Let’s just store everything in UTC”. But there are problems in taking that approach too which we will discuss in the talk. Jon Skeet, the author of the leading library to handle dates and times in the .NET world summarizes the date & time problem best by saying: “Either you don’t know it is difficult, or you know it is difficult but you assume that it is so difficult that you’ll never ever get the right answer so you will just be OK with getting things occasionally wrong”. But there is one way by which we *can* tame the great date and time beasts - thorough understanding of the concepts. We will start by looking at some of the most common questions that come up when dealing with parsing, storing and interacting with dates and times: What are timezones? What is daylight savings time? How do I store timestamps in the database? Why can’t I just store UTC everywhere? How often do things change in the world? Why is this so hard? All these are very normal questions to ask. And they cause problems when not handled properly in production. Another very subtle but important nuance for this conference is that we live in a country   which only has 1 timezone and where daylight savings isn’t observed. Hence, we have the privilege of having to never “change” our watches and clocks unless we go our of our country somewhere. So unless we have some prior experience with dealing with date and time in software systems, most of us   start in the dark. Building software however expects a clean understanding of dates and times and the associated nuances. Outline of the talk This session aims to address 3 key points: Introduce the audience to the concepts around time and date and timestamps Highlight the complexities that arise from storing timestamps Give practical advise on how to solve the complexities predictably in a production scenario This talk aims to equip the audience with the concepts and knowledge they need to solve date and time problems in any environment / language they work in. There will also be code samples in Python to better illustrate the concepts. Not in scope This talk will *NOT* deal with the problems of the scientific / high precision computing world where ideas like leap seconds are important. Prerequisites: This talk is aimed at individuals who are beginners to the world of dates and times. The part about handling things in production will have information that will be of use to seniors to validate their approaches in systems they are responsible for as well. Speaker

Voltron Data, in collaboration with the Meta open-source team, has been developing PyVelox, a Python package that adds bindings to commonly used Velox APIs. This addition empowers Velox developers to leverage Python’s interactive REPL, enabling them to efficiently explore and triage Velox vectors and associated data components. Consequently, PyVelox enables Python developers to execute data queries, including SQL queries, across a wide spectrum of workloads such as batch processing, stream processing, AI/ML, and more. Velox stands out as a unified engine for data execution, offering a versatile execution engine that seamlessly integrates with diverse data compute architectures. This integration minimizes redundancy while extending consistent functionality across various frameworks. Currently, Velox finds applications in engines like Presto and Apache Spark, alongside Meta's internal streaming service XStream, with integration plans underway for Apache Flink. Previously, say for a data compute architecture built on Spark or Presto, the user needed the respective engine for the execution of data queries, however, Velox facilitates using the same execution engine for both of them, thus unifying the process for any data compute operation. This unification not only reduces complexity but also ensures universal semantics throughout the entire data lifecycle, thus features generated during ad hoc training, or online execution remain consistent. In this talk, we aim to briefly discuss Velox, its philosophy and methodology. Following this, we shall move to PyVelox, its data types, expressions, and functionalities, thus demonstrating the simplicity of running database queries on Velox using Python APIs without losing efficiency. Outline: Velox Incubation Open-sourced by Facebook in late 2021. Velox development over the years Need for PyVelox PyVelox Developments Data types Expressions Serialization-deserialization Conversion to-and-from Apache Arrow Type and function signatures Demo PyVelox future goals Prerequisites: Knowledge of data engineering and analytics will be helpful. The project is an execution engine, that can be integrated into a data compute architecture, so experience with SQL or data relational queries will be beneficial. The talk will include topics on Python bindings based on pybind11, thus Python and intermediate C++ knowledge is expected.

Info: Evaluating Generative Vision Models: Insights into the Fréchet Inception Distance and CLIP   PyCon India 2023 Toggle navigation PyCon India 2023 Login / Register PyCon India 2023 Proposals Evaluating Generative Vision Models: Insights into the Fréchet Inception Distance and CLIP Evaluating Generative Vision Models: Insights into the Fréchet Inception Distance and CLIP Mayank Khanduja     12 Aug, 2023 1 Vote Description: There are plenty of Generative AI models for Computer Vision in the industry and numerous techniques to evaluate those models. However, none of the evaluation techniques can surpass the human level of evaluation for these models. Unlike object detection, segmentation and classification models, which machines can evaluate better than humans, generative models like Stable Diffusion, StyleGAN, CycleGAN, and Pix2Pix require both quantitative and manual inspection to evaluate their performance. If a user sees hundreds of generative pretrained vision models on online platforms like HuggingFace or Kaggle, how will they evaluate and select the best model suitable for their dataset? Additionally, if they train their own model, how will they know how robust the trained model is? Manually inspecting thousands of generated images by the model is quite challenging and time-consuming; hence, an evaluation metric is required to measure it quantitatively. This is a highly active area of research currently. We will cover two metrics Fréchet Inception Distance   which compares two sets of images by leveraging a pre-trained InceptionNet model. CLIP Score which measures compatibility of Image-Caption pairs by leveraging a pre-trained CLIP model. These metrics are industry standard for their respective tasks currently. Outline of the Talk Challenges faced while evaluating Generative vision models. Properties of AI generated images/text that need to be considered for evaluation Gain an intuitive understanding of FID and CLIP score. Understand the metrics mathematically and derive the formula. Implementation of the derived formula in python. Apply the python code on a use case by comparing two generative models on a particular dataset. Look into a few caveats of these metrics on some uncommon datasets and explore how we can tackle them. In the code, we will use PyTorch and some basic Python libraries for our task. Key takeaways from the talk You will get to know how close these metrics perform as compared to human judgement. Researchers will be able to compare their models with the existing benchmarks. Developers will get to know when to replace their models based on these metrics without human intervention. You will deeply understand the equations behind these metrics and implement them in python from scratch. Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of Python, Convolutional Neural Networks and Statistics Speaker

How I restarted my career by contributing to Open Source? Bowrna   16 Jul, 2023 1 Vote Description: This talk is about my experience of restarting my work after taking a career break. I had to take a break after my maternity leave due to increasing stress at work and my physical health was not in good shape. While I wanted a break I was also afraid that I won't be able to start working again. So I made a concrete plan on how I am going to spend my time during the career break and started focussing on the open source project in the little time I got. From then I got opportunity to secure scholarship and internship in Outreachy programme and worked in Airflow project. That was the turning point and from then I gradually started making more open source contribution to Airflow. It took me about a year to gain momentum and I started checking for part-time opportunity as I have to be the primary care-giver for my kid too. And finally I landed in job that perfectly fits me and here I am pursuing my work that I was afraid that I wouldn't come back. In this talk I will tell about making first contribution to open source, how to make positive impact on open source project and get more out of it, being your own driver and how working consistently in open source pays off. Prerequisites: This is a talk to inspire people how they can restart or change into tech career by making contribution to open source software. This gives explanation on guideline about how to choose projects for making the first contribution, career opportunities that opens up after making contribution etc. This will be useful for any person who wants to restart their career after a break.

In this journey, the question "why" acts as the compass that guides a statistician to travel from mere knowledge land to profound understanding. In this talk, we will take a hands-on and practical approach towards explaining the concepts of Causal Inference and Discovery with python. In this talk's context, Causal Inference is the process of applying data science/ML libraries along with CI libraries such as doWhy and econML to determine whether a change in one attribute causes a change in another thing. This is a generic deduction process moving from generics to specifics. Causal Discovery is the process of applying data science/ML libraries to identify and explore causal relationships without prior hypothesis. This is a induction process moving from specifics to generics. We will highlight how we can use observational data and analyze it with domain knowledge to come up with causal models. In the spirit of Plausible reasoning, the theme of this talk will be the following: "Experience modifies beliefs. A sentinel being learns from experience. A good scientist endeavors to extract the most correct belief from a given experience” In the demo section: We will show case the open source python libraries being applied on practical causal experiments to answer questions such as: 1. Why does a computer system get infected by a virus? 2. Why was a virus not able to infect a system running a particular software? 3. Why is a software running sluggishly? and we will empower the audience with the practical knowledge to use the framework to use against their own data corresponding to the problem domain they are working on to answer causal questions. In the process, we will also cover Prof. Judea Pearl's ladder of causation and explorer Pearlian perspective of causal inference and discovery with dowhy calculus. Prerequisites: The session will cover everything that needs to be known to understand the concepts. Basic statistical inference concepts Basic programming concepts Basic Numpy, Scipy knowledge is prefered Content URLs: https://malwareresearch.medium.com/the-curious-case-of-app-collusion-81b702266098 https://malwareresearch.medium.com/curious-connections-ad3aaa9f5413 https://malwareresearch.medium.com/context-bias-deep-learning-84f2447f4f26 Speaker

Do you want to take your skills to the next level and achieve maximum performance while minimising memory usage? Look no further, here is Zero-Copy in Python! Zero-copy is a technique in computer programming that allows data to be transferred between different parts of a program without being copied to intermediate buffers. In Python, this technique can be achieved using the memory view object, which provides a view into the memory of other objects. Learn how to efficiently manipulate large datasets and optimise your code with the help of this powerful tool. Whether you're working with sockets, objects or memory profiling, memory view is your key to faster and more efficient Python programming. In today's data-driven world, efficient memory management is critical for achieving optimal performance in Python. Memory view and byte array provide a powerful combination of tools for managing bytes and memory in Python, enabling zero-copy interactions that can significantly improve performance and reduce memory usage. Memory view is a built-in Python class that provides a zero-copy interface to the memory of an object, allowing efficient manipulation of large data sets. Memory view objects can be used to share memory between different parts of a program without creating intermediate copies of the data, which can significantly improve the performance of Python code. This feature is particularly useful when working with large arrays, binary data, or network programming using sockets. Memory view can also be used in conjunction with the buffer protocol to work with objects in a zero-copy manner. Overall, memory view is a powerful tool for Python developers looking to optimise their code and improve performance. Outline of the talk: Understand what is Zero-Copy Compare traditional mechanism with zero-copy of sending file Look into Python example of each mechanism os.sendfile  and it's zero-copy implementation Python's bytes  Basic syntax and examples Python's bytearray  Basic syntax and example Introduction to Memory View Understand buffer protocol Dive into Memory View features Comparison of memoryview  performance Applications & Benefits Prerequisites: Python knowledge Speaker

Info: Building modular plugin-based Python distributions with Plux   PyCon India 2023 Toggle navigation PyCon India 2023 Login / Register PyCon India 2023 Proposals Building modular plugin-based Python distributions with Plux Building modular plugin-based Python distributions with Plux Harsh Mishra     23 May, 2023 5 Votes Description: Entry points are a mechanism for an installed distribution to advertising components it provides to be discovered and used by other code. Although Python entry points make it easy to discover and dynamically load code from third-party distributions, Python has no higher-level concept of a plugin, making it challenging to reuse for common patterns. Moreover, most existing plugin libraries are designed to work with explicit code importing or rely on conventions to locate code. In this talk, we will explore Plux, a dynamic code-loading framework that does not rely on conventions, explicit code imports, or manually declaring entry points. This creates a highly easy-to-use and flexible way to declare and use plugins and build modular & pluggable distributions. With Plux, Callback hooks, functional plugins, class-based plugins, and even values can be easily exposed as plugins without manually modifying the list of entry points We will also showcase several patterns we have implemented in Plux and how you can have thousands of plugins in your Python applications that would be scalable. The outline for this talk is as follows: Introduction to dynamic code loading   Dynamic code loading patterns in Python applications   Getting started with Plux   Building a Python application with Plux   Q&A   Prerequisites: This talk requires an understanding of the following: Python packages and distributions Entry points in Python and their purpose If you want to write plugins using Python and scale modular distributions, this talk will interest you!

After days of debugging, you get it to work. But after building your image, you're surprised to see that the image size is hundreds of Megabytes big. You're looking for ways to reduce the size. As a general practice, you try to use smaller parent images like python-alpine. Now all of a sudden, your package installation breaks due to missing libraries. Alpine, you know :P Finally, you somehow figured it all out and made it work. But still, your image is not as small as you expect it to be. What else could you do? Try reducing the layers, try multi-stage builds. But what if you absolutely want to create smaller images for your projects? This talk will look at an experimental project to build the smallest possible images for Python projects. That too absolutely "FROM scratch". You might know what a scratch image means if you come from a Docker world. Scratch is a docker keyword, meaning that the container will have no base image. The size of the image would be 0 Bytes. We will see what it takes to run some Python code in a scratch container. While we build scratch containers, we will evaluate their effectiveness, performance, and security against traditional containers. During this part, we will quickly review container security tools  . Prerequisites: Basic programming Docker or other container technologies Familiar with building images with multiple-stages Speaker

It sacrifices a little bit of its performance to provide more flexibility / high-level programming features. Python is 33 times slower than Java and 56 times slower than C language. Python is relatively very slow because C is compiled and Python on the other hand is interpreted. The compiler transforms the C code into machine code, all at once. The interpreter on the other hand has to read, interpret, and perform each line of code and update the machine state  . When a program is compiled into machine code, the CPU can execute it directly. However, when it comes to interpreters, the CPU runs the interpreter, and the interpreter itself executes the program. Hence, making it slower than other programming languages. I will demonstrate how making small yet impactful changes to your code can improve the performance of your application. I have curated around 15 to 20 such examples where we can improve the runtime of Python code significantly. Prerequisites: Basic Python syntax and built-in functions. Speaker

It can be completely automated on cloud or it can have some discretionary inputs. It can also be just a dashboard that filters data based on the defined parameters. A system also consists of defining and backtesting the strategies which can have positive Expected value in the market. A good system starts with formulating the hypothesis, collecting the data for testing the hypothesis, and then figuring out the statistical significance of the results. The system then aims to forward test the strategy in the live market without any actual capital deployed. Once the forward testing gets completed, a small amount of capital is deployed to check the market impact and the charges associated with the strategy. The capital is slowly ramped up until the maximum value is extracted out of the strategy. The strategy is decommissioned once it breached the stat threshold.

Or staring at the GitHub Action in your PR waiting for it to turn green ... Writing tests is great and improves stability and allows developers to build things faster. But at some point, every project reaches a state where the test suite makes developers slower cause it just takes way too long to marge changes! I've been in such projects more than once, and I decided to go about looking for a solution to this issue. In this talk, I will discuss the many available options: The simple approaches that pytest provides out of the box Breaking down into smaller projects Ability to cache test results We will deep dive into the 3rd approach which helps the most when working actively on a large project. The typical development flow most projects follow is: The developer creates a branch to work on from the current "base" branch   The developer writes or modifies code in their branch + write new tests A developer wants to test if the modifications cause any tests to fail At this point, the developer wants to run 2 tests: First, the tests they have written Second, the tests that may start failing due to their changes We will go through how to query the coverage database of the "base" branch to find out which tests belong to the second category. And then run only them with pytest - hence speeding up the CI environment significantly. Prerequisites: The participants should know: Basic python Understand SQL or sqlite basics Be comfortable writing tests and be aware of how unit tests work Be aware of tools like git Speaker

A lot of times, every programmer is focused on learning new things coming up in the language, but rarely one learns how to deal with errors. Dealing with errors is one of the most common problems in any programming language. In Python, you can either prevent errors before they happen or handle those errors after they happen. In programming, there are two opposite approaches to facing errors -Look before you Leap  and Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission . In my talk, I will quickly dive into both these strategies. In the Look Before You Leap  Style, one first check whether their conditions will succeed and proceeds further. Different code examples will be walked through to showcase this style. Similarly, the EAFP coding style is characterized by using try … except statements to catch and handle errors and exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of your code. This coding approach is quite popular in Python Community. It is mainly because of the fast and efficient error handling in Python. This talk will delve much deeper than my already published article on the same topic: https://medium.com/codex/preventing-handling-errors-in-python-c1ae1f2fa689 Brief Outline: 1.

With the increasing complexity of AI systems, there has been a growing need to understand and interpret the decisions made by these models. Enter Explainable AI  , a field dedicated to making AI models transparent and comprehensible to humans. In this blog, we will explore the concept of Explainable AI and delve into practical techniques using Python to interpret and explain the decisions made by AI models. Understanding Explainable AI: Explainable AI refers to the ability of an AI model to provide clear explanations for its decisions and actions. It aims to bridge the gap between the "black box" nature of AI models and the human need for understanding and trust. By providing insights into the internal workings of AI models, XAI techniques help answer questions such as "Why did the model make this prediction?" or "What factors influenced the model's decision?" Techniques for Explainable AI: Several techniques have been developed to achieve explainability in AI models. Let's explore a few popular ones and discuss how to implement them using Python: Feature Importance: One common approach to understanding a model's decision-making process is by identifying the most influential features. Techniques like permutation importance, partial dependence plots, and SHAP   can be used to measure the impact of each feature on the model's predictions. LIME  : LIME is a model-agnostic method that explains the predictions of any machine learning model by creating locally interpretable approximations. It generates explanations by perturbing the input data and observing the changes in the model's output. Python libraries such as lime and eli5 provide implementations of LIME. SHAP  : SHAP values provide a unified framework for explaining the output of any machine learning model. They assign each feature in the input a value that represents its contribution to the model's prediction. The SHAP library in Python offers a range of tools to compute and visualize SHAP values. Decision Trees and Rule Extraction: Decision trees are inherently interpretable models that can be used to explain complex models. By training a decision tree on the same data used to train the AI model, we can extract rules that mimic the decision-making process. Python's scikit-learn library provides convenient tools for building decision trees. Model Visualization: Visualizing AI models can provide valuable insights into their inner workings. Techniques such as saliency maps, activation maximization, and gradient-weighted class activation mapping   can help highlight the regions in an image that influenced the model's decision. Libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV offer functionalities to implement these techniques. Conclusion: Explainable AI has become increasingly crucial in ensuring transparency, accountability, and trust in AI systems. By using Python and various XAI techniques, we can gain valuable insights into AI models and interpret their decisions. In this blog, we have explored some popular techniques for explainability, such as feature importance, LIME, SHAP, decision trees, and model visualization. These techniques serve as a starting point for understanding and explaining the inner workings of AI models, enabling us to make more informed decisions and address potential biases or errors. With continued research and development, Explainable AI will play an integral role in the responsible deployment of AI systems in various domains.

Theory and experiment have traditionally dominated scientific research: one person constructs a clearly stated theory, which is then continuously improved upon using experimental evidence, which is then analysed to generate new predictions. But as machine learning technology has advanced quickly and the volume of scientific data has drastically increased, data-driven approaches have gained popularity. In that case, a theory already in existence is not necessary; instead, a machine learning algorithm can be utilised to examine a scientific issue using only data. The problem is, using a purely data-driven approach like this can have significant downsides. Researchers are now looking for ways to include this type of prior scientific knowledge into machine learning workflows, in the blossoming field of scientific machine learning  . I will describe physics-informed neural networks in this session, which are becoming an effective technique to apply physical concepts to machine learning. Since this a fairly new topic, research and experimentation is continuously being done on it. The goal of my talk is to invoke curiosity and awareness of such techniques among the young conference attendees, especially in India as an alternative research goal compared to the "traditional" usages of Machine Learning. Here is a draft outline of what I will cover : I. Introduction A. Increasing popularity of machine learning in scientific research B. Limitations of purely data-driven approaches C. Introducing the concept of physics-informed neural networks   D. Significance of incorporating prior scientific knowledge into machine learning II. The Need for Physics-Informed Neural Networks A. Traditional dominance of theory and experiment in scientific research B. Challenges of handling large volumes of scientific data C. Potential downsides of purely data-driven approaches III. Understanding Physics-Informed Neural Networks   A. Definition and core principles of PINNs B. Leveraging physical concepts to enhance machine learning models C. How PINNs bridge the gap between science and machine learning D. Overview of ongoing research and experimentation in PINNs IV. Benefits and Applications of Physics-Informed Neural Networks A. Advantages of incorporating prior scientific knowledge B. Enhancing interpretability and explainability of machine learning models C. Potential applications in various scientific domains D.

Python's standard library urllib.request does not provide support for pooling/re-using a connection. Each request made using urllib.request establishes a new connection to the server and closes it after the response is received, but for multiple requests to the same server, it is better to use the same connection as with each new connection a separate socket connection is created and by reusing sockets the requests will take up lesser resources on the server's end and provide faster response time at client's end. Connection pooling combined with Threading can provide a significant performance boost. The talk will cover making our own thread-safe HTTP connection pool in a progressive manner using the built-in http library and how to make it thread-safe, followed by a benchmarking example that compares making requests to a local HTTP server with builtin http, simple connection pool and using threading alongside connection pool. The outline for the talk is as follows: Introduction to Connection Pooling and why we need it?   What does "thread-safe" means?   Introduction to Queue for making thread-safe programs   Building a simple Thread safe connection pool   Benchmarking using the Simple Connection Pool, to see it all happen   Q&A   Prerequisites: As this is a beginner-focused talk, the only pre-requisite is Python.

Legal studies is a new frontier in this domain and the use of data science applications to analyse legal data like judgment documents, case orders etc., has just begun globally. However, there is a challenge in performing such empirical legal research   -- lack of structured legal-judicial datasets. This is because legal-judicial data is often unstructured and textual in nature. Currently, the researchers performing ELR to extract relevant variables from the legal-judicial texts   through manual annotation. A few governments and judicial institutions are also providing metadata to help researchers do ELR. However, the datasets generated from current approaches are not exhaustive and are polluted with the presence of false positives and false negatives. Legal research is stymied due to this poor state of data, eventually affecting legal reforms of a polity. In this context, Natural Language Processing   can help create structured legal-judicial datasets from these unstructured texts. Specifically, I use an open-source NLP library called "OpenNyAI" which is trained on Indian court judgments. OpenNyAI currently has two NLP models - Named Entity Recognition   and Extractive Summarisation. As an experiment, I piloted these models on a sample of 51 POCSO   court judgements to develop structured datasets of the relevant statutes and provisions. I found that the datasets produced are more exhaustive than the official metadata released in 45% of the cases. The produced datasets are also validated by legal researchers. I further plan to use NLP to create structured datasets from all judgments related to child rights in India delivered during the period of 2015-2022. The longitudinal data on child rights will help researchers perform ELR on legislation enacted to protect children and advocate for policy reforms. In this talk, I would like to talk about: a) The open-source NLP library called OpenNyAI which will help create structured datasets from Indian court judgments. b) Challenges posed in the datafication of unstructured textual documents using the case study of the experiment on POCSO cases. c) How we plan to scale it across states to create a data ecosystem of child rights in the country.

But what can you do as a developer to avoid being the bad guy? How can project leads enable their teams to reduce the occurrence of broken builds? In talking within our own teams, we discovered that many developers weren’t running sufficient integration and End to End tests in their local environments because it’s too difficult to set up and administer test environments in an efficient way. That’s why we decided to rethink our entire local testing process in hopes of cutting down on the headaches and valuable time wasted. Enter Kuttl. Connecting Kuttl to CI builds has empowered our developers to easily configure a development environment locally that accurately matches the final test environment — without needing to become an expert CI admin themselves. These days, we hear, “Who broke the build?” far less often — and you can too! Session Outline: In this session, We’ll cover: ● A quick history of our testing challenges and what led us to Kuttl ● The benefits of our new testing approach — easy to configure and minimal investment ● How we combine Kuttl and CI pipelines for more streamlined testing and fewer broken builds Session Key Takeaways: When and why we decided to rethink our e2e testing practices and our subsequent discovery of Kuttl. Why Kuttl has been the perfect tool for our developers to perform better local integration/e2e testing without the burden of becoming their own CI administrators. A detailed account of how we utilize Kuttl to set up development environments locally that match our final test environments - without needing to become an expert CI admin themselves.

Info: Closing the faucet - fixing leaky applications by shifting privacy left   PyCon India 2023 Toggle navigation PyCon India 2023 Login / Register PyCon India 2023 Proposals Closing the faucet - fixing leaky applications by shifting privacy left Closing the faucet - fixing leaky applications by shifting privacy left Gaurav Gogia     11 Jul, 2023 10 Votes Description: Software development is increasingly turning into an industrialised mechanical process. With the abundance of low code/no code software solutions and magical APIs it has become more convenient than ever to create beautiful applications that deliver the right business logic. Building on top of existing standard libraries or accepted industry standards is the norm instead of re-building things from scratch. However, during all this rush towards building the next big app we are somewhere forgetting data privacy. Slapping long privacy policy documents only leads to false acceptance on the user’s end without really ever going through the policy document. And even when these documents are made easy to understand, we’ve always looked at data privacy from a DLP perspective. We look at all the databases we have, we lock them down and build RBACs around them. However, we forget to look at the root cause of the problem. The very code that power our applications. Now, imagine applications that have privacy built-in. Imagine detecting and mitigating all the privacy violations pre-deployment. In this research, we are going to discuss DevPrivOps with an open source software that does just that. As Python developers we love meaning-ful exceptions, errors, and logs. We want to make sure we understand if something goes wrong then why exactly it is going wrong and where it is going wrong. Another reason we love to Python is because of the sheer number of libraries availablef or virutall any task. Deep learning? Tensorflow, Pytorch, ChatGPT APIs Databases? Almost every major database under the sun However, when deadlines are close and features have to be released ASAP, we sometimes cut corners with privacy and security. While there are several solutions for security in CI/CD pipelines. Let's talk about privacy in pre-deployment checks today. What's the point? What's this talk about? The talk is about enabling privacy of Django/Flask/FastAPI Python applications using modern Privacy Engineering tools. The end goal of this talk is to ensure YOU can write your Python applications without the fear of leaking user data. modern privacy engineering is all about pushing left aka static code analysis. This will allow us to detect leaky logs, API calls, database queries, and other third party connections before the applction is deployed. Flow of the Talk 1. Why do we have data leaks?   2. What kind of data is being targeted?   3. Patching the pipeline   4. Tools of the Trade   5. Live demo   - Loading sample python application in Joern and running graph queries - Running privado scan on the application - Modifying scanner policies/writing custom policies - Patching application code - Scanning the application code again post-changes Prerequisites: Basic python Basic understanding of static code analysis Basic understanding of CI/CD pipelines Content URLs: https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00927 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_property_graph https://petsymposium.org/popets/2023/popets-2023-0046.pdf https://github.com/Privado-Inc/privado-core Presentation Link Speaker
